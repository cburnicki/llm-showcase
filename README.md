Because `create_vector_store.py` and `rag_showcase.py` utilize the OpenAI API, the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable has to be set. However, you can also very easily use a local LLM instead to create embeddings as explained in the [LangChain documentation](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/get_started/quickstart/#retrieval-chain).
